<h2 id="A"> Why UltraSound Imaging? </h2>

***Course Motivation:***
> As “biomedical engineers”, it is important to understand the physics, design, and types of ultrasound imaging modalities as common diagnostic tools in healthcare facilities

<h2 id="B"> What UltraSound Imaging Can Do? (6 Modes) </h2>

1. B-Mode (Brightness) - Real/Fixed Time
   * Cross Sectional Images
   * Constructed from: **Echoes** and **Scattering**
2. M-Mode (Motion)
   * Pixel-wise Movement
   * Calculate Distance
   * **Example:** Cardiology Operations
3. Color Doppler
   * Organ Structure
   * **Example:** Determine Blood Velocity and Direction
4. Doppler
   * Pulsed Waves
5. Intravascular (Blood Vessels)
6. 3D UltraSound
   * Sequences of 2D Images
   * **Example:** Obstatrics Operations

<h2 id="D"> Role of UltraSound in Medical Imaging (Unique Characteristics) </h2>

* Form of **Non-ionizing Radiation** and **Safe**
* **Less Expensive** than other Imaging Modalities of Similar Capabilities
* **High Rsolution** (mm Range) - up to 50 Micron
* **Mobile** and **Portable**

<h2 id="E"> Drawbacks of UltraSound Imaging </h2>

* Organs containing **Gases** and **Bony Structures** cannot be adequately imaged without introducing specialized procedures
* **Limited Window Only** (e.g. Heart and Neonatal Brain)
* Depends on **Operator Skill**
* **Patients Dependency** (e.g. Obese Patients)
* Needs **Medium** for Propagation through

<h2 id="F"> Basic Idea </h2>

<h2 id="G"> Principles of UltraSound </h2>

Each echo is displayed at a point in the image, which corresponds to the relative position of its origin within the body cross section, resulting in a scaled map of echoproducing features
➢ The brightness of the image at each point is related to the strength or amplitude of the echo, giving rise to the term Bmode (brightness mode)

<h2 id="H"> Physics of UltraSound </h2>

* **Mechanical longitudinal Waves**
* "UltraSound" refers to frequencies **greater** than **20 kHz**

Propagation of UltraSound Waves | Comments |
:------------------------------:|:--------:|
![Propagation of UltraSound](https://github.com/mostafa20223/SBME-4th-Year-2nd-Term-/blob/main/Equipment/Dr-Ehab/imgs/Lec1/Propagation.png) | Particles of medium **oscillate** *backwards* and *forwards* along the **direction of propagation** |

<h3 id="J"> Definitions of Wave </h3>

> Frequency (f): Number of oscillations or wave crests passing a stationary observer per second and is determined by the source of the sound wave (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second)

> Wavelength (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\large&space;\lambda" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\large&space;\lambda" title="\large \lambda" /></a>): Distance between consecutive wave crests or other similar points on the wave

> Speed/Velocity (c): Determined by medium in which it is travelling
>> Examples are the speed of sound in air (330 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=m&space;s^{-1}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m&space;s^{-1}" title="m s^{-1}" /></a>) and water (1480 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=m&space;s^{-1}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m&space;s^{-1}" title="m s^{-1}" /></a>)


<h2 id=""> Notes </h2>

* UltraSound Machines have different battery attachment
* UltraSound Workflow:
  * Diagnostic
  * Screening (Not Common)
* Resolution of UltraSound may be improved if frequency is increased (Proportional)
* Usage of Gel: To make sure that there is no **Air** between **Transducer** and **Patient's Body**
* UltraSound is mainly a **High Frequency Sound Wave**
* Sound Wave Velocity:
  * Air: 340 m/s
  * Water: 1500 - 1540 m/s
* Echoes: Relative Position of Organ
* Frequency Range (Medical Imaging): **2 - 20 MHz**
* UltraSound may be used in **Therapeutic** (e.g. Lithotripsy)
* Wave is descriped by:
  * Phase
  * Frequency
  * Velocity
