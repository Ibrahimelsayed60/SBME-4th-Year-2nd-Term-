<h2 id="A"> Why UltraSound Imaging? </h2>

***Course Motivation:***
    
    As “biomedical engineers”, it is important to understand the physics, design, and types of ultrasound imaging modalities as common diagnostic tools in healthcare facilities

<h2 id="B"> What UltraSound Imaging Can Do? (6 Modes) </h2>

1. B-Mode (Brightness) - Real/Fixed Time
2. M-Mode (Motion)
   * Pixel-wise Movement
   * Calculate Distance
   * **Example:** Cardiology Operations
3. Color Doppler
   * Organ Structure
   * **Example:** Determine Blood Velocity and Direction
4. Doppler
   * Pulsed Waves
5. Intravascular (Blood Vessels)
6. 3D UltraSound
   * Sequences of 2D Images
   * **Example:** Obstatrics Operations

<h2 id="C"> UltraSound Machine </h2>

<h2 id="D"> Role of UltraSound in Medical Imaging (Unique Characteristics) </h2>

* Form of **Non-ionizing Radiation** and **Safe**
* **Less Expensive** than other Imaging Modalities of Similar Capabilities
* **High Rsolution** (mm Range) - up to 50 Micron
* **Mobile** and **Portable**

<h2 id="E"> Drawbacks of UltraSound Imaging </h2>

* Organs containing **Gases** and **Bony Structures** cannot be adequately imaged without introducing specialized procedures
* **Limited Window Only** (e.g. Heart and Neonatal Brain)
* Depends on **Operator Skill**
* **Patients Dependency** (e.g. Obese Patients)
* Needs **Medium** for Propagation

<h2 id="F"> Basic Idea </h2>

<h2 id="H"> Notes </h2>

* UltraSound Machines have different battery attachment
* UltraSound Workflow:
  * Diagnostic
  * Screening (Not Common)
* Resolution of UltraSound may be improved if frequency is increased (Proportional)
* Usage of Gel: To make sure that there is no **Air** between **Transducer** and **Patient's Body**
* UltraSound is mainly a **High Frequency Sound Wave**
